# Fake-News-Detector

## The following is a Fake News Detector. 
It was built using a Random Forest Classifier and Natural Language Processing.
The code in this notebook, when given an example article title, produces a classification of either a 0 or a 1, not fake news or fake news, respectively. This is meant to be the first of many iterations; all suggestions are welcome.
All work was completed by Katy Spalding, November 2018.
